The first PyCon in Uruguay is looking for proposals to fill the conference tracks. 

This event is scheduled for Saturday 10 and Sunday 11 of November at the LATU Conference Center in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Proposals can be one of two kinds, traditional talks or sprints. It's planned that all presentations will take place on Saturday 10 and one coding sprint (hackaton) on Sunday 11 of November.

Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects to tutorials and case studies. As long as a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program.
